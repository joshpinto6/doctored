# /home

a couple of _the_ most common questions you might have.

## What?

- A blog theme which prioritizes uniqueness, technical complexity, and minimalism.

- **For a full list of features, see [/about](/about).**

## Why?

Because there is no theme quite like what I would want.

## How?

Doctored uses the following technologies:

1. Jekyll, which enables markdown-powered static sites
2. Tailwind CSS, which makes styling so much easier!

## Where?

Right here, of course! But it can also be on your website: Instructions coming soon.

## Who?

The theme was made by [me]() with heavy inspiration taken from [some blogs I like]() and [this blog post](https://danilafe.com/blog/blog_microfeatures/) by Daniel Fedorin on microfeatures.

## When?

The version of the site you're viewing now was built on {{ site.git.last_commit.commit_date }}
