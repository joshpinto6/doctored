a couple of _the_ most common questions <small>These are also some of the most common questions that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five_Ws">journalists</a> have!</small> you might have.

## What?

- A blog theme which prioritizes uniqueness, technical complexity, and sophistication<small>While sophist-ication may be redundant for complexity, it describes the the theme's vibe.</small>

- **For a full list of features, see [/about]({{ '/about' | relative_url }}).**

## Why?

Because there is no theme quite like what I would want.

## How?

Doctored uses the following technologies:

1. Jekyll, which enables markdown-powered static sites
2. Tailwind CSS<small>Using Node and PostCSS, this helped me strike a balance between maintainability and slimness.</small>, which makes styling so much easier!

## Where?

Right here, of course! But it can also be on your website: Instructions coming soon.

## Who?

- The theme was made by [me]() with heavy inspiration taken from some blogs I like [links pending].
- and [this blog post](https://danilafe.com/blog/blog_microfeatures/) by Daniel Fedorin on microfeatures.
- Also quite inspired by Mani Kumar's Xterm [theme](https://manid2.github.io/hugo-xterm/) for Hugo.
- Lastly, big thanks to [Kieren J. Underwood](https://github.com/JacobU/markdown-jekyll-preprocessor/tree/master), [Kaushik Gopal](https://kau.sh/blog/jekyll-footnote-tufte-sidenote/), and [Dave Liepmann](https://edwardtufte.github.io/tufte-css/) and for their contributions to markdown-based sidenotes for Jekyll (and the massively-inspiring Tufte CSS respectively)!
